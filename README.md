# ComeTogether
Project for the WintR Hackathon

## WintR Hackathon
The WintR Hackathon challenged contestants to develop a piece of technology incorporating the phrase:
"Technology is best when it brings people together"

## What is ComeTogether?
ComeTogether is supposed to be an answer to this prompt and is the result of up to 28 hours of coding. 
The project is a python-django web app allowing users to publish posts, in which they can
animate other's to join them at an event, advertise an event (for example a hackathon) or simply search
for fellow mates to complete projects (like for example a hackathon) with together.

## Technological details
The implementation of this project is very simple:
 - the backend utilizes the python-django framework to handle databases, user authentication, http request-response handling, ... (pretty much everything)
 - the database used is a SQLite db; however, it might as well just be a SQL db or any other database.
 - in the frontend the implementation occurs through the use of css, javascript and html. No libraries for these are used.
